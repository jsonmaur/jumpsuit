# Announcement
### Jumpsuit is now officially *DEPRECATED*. Thanks for your support over the life of Jumpsuit. It served a great purpose, but we now are strongly urging you to use idiomatic (vanilla) redux in conjunction with redux-thunk. It will most certainly improve your apps testability, stability, and scalability.
